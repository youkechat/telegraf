  ## Change the file mode bits on unix sockets.  These permissions may not be
  ## respected by some platforms, to safely restrict write permissions it is best
  ## to place the socket into a directory that has previously been created
  ## with the desired permissions.

  ## Maximum socket buffer size (in bytes when no unit specified).
  ## For stream sockets, once the buffer fills up, the sender will start backing up.
  ## For datagram sockets, once the buffer fills up, metrics will start dropping.
  ## Defaults to the OS default.

  ## Each data format has its own unique set of configuration options, read
  ## more about them here:

  ## Content encoding for message payloads, can be set to "gzip" to or
  ## "identity" to apply no encoding.
