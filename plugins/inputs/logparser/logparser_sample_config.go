  ## ** as a "super asterisk". ie:

  ##   /var/log/apache.log -> only tail the apache log file

  ## while telegraf is running (and that match the "files" globs) will always
  ## be read from the beginning.

  ## Parse logstash-style "grok" patterns:
  [inputs.logparser.grok]
    ## This is a list of patterns to check the given log file(s) for.
    ## Note that adding patterns here increases processing time. The most
    ## efficient configuration is to have one pattern per logparser.
    ## Other common built-in patterns are:
    ##   %{COMMON_LOG_FORMAT}   (plain apache & nginx access logs)
    ##   %{COMBINED_LOG_FORMAT} (access logs + referrer & agent)

    ## don't already include an offset
    ## e.g. 04/06/2016 12:41:45 data one two 5.43µs
    ##
    ## Default: "" which renders UTC
    ## Options are as follows:
    ##   1. Local             -- interpret based on machine localtime
    ##   2. "Canada/Eastern"  -- Unix TZ values like those found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
    ##   3. UTC               -- or blank/unspecified, will return timestamp in UTC
    # timezone = "Canada/Eastern"

    ## When set to "disable", timestamp will not incremented if there is a
    ## duplicate.
